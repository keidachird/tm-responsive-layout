# Responsive Layout

This is a simple responsive layout created as a homework for [Techmagic Academy](https://www.techmagic.co/techmagic-academy). It uses HTML5 and CSS3 to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

This project contains a gallery of the Solar System and a list of links for every object in the gallery. Every link navigates to an object of the Solar System it refers.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the layout [here](https://keidachird.github.io/tm-responsive-layout/).

Here are screenshots of the page in 3 different resolutions as well:

- Large resolution:

## Notes

- Layout is written with a mobile-first approach.
- Both HTML and CSS pass validation on [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/).
- For reseting CSS styles I used `normalize.css`.
- I decided to not use Sass here because of the simplicity of this project.
- For images I used `<picture>` tag with 3 different sizes of each picture (240px, 360px, 480px for every breakpoint)
